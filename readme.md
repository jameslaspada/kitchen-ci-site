# Test Kitchen's Static Site
This is an exact copy of the Test [Kitchen](http://kitchen.ci) static website. Not exactly sure why opscode, and the heavy water folks don't maintain a Test Kitchen wiki from Github as well as the kitchen.ci site. However as it turns out, the cleverly picked domain name for test kitchen(.ci), is blocked by many companies. I can only assume it was chosen to be representative of CI (Continuous Integration), however it is also the same domain for the Ivory Coast. So if you belong to one of those big companies who blocks the ci domain as well, this might be a solution for you too. I wanted to be able to access the documentation for test kitchen on my work machine without having to see those dreaded http forbidden messages. So here it is, an exact copy of their site that you can run locally on your machine, or spin up an ec2 instance to share with your internal DevOps team.
